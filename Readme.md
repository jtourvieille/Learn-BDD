# Document generation

We now have a quite seducing application. It is covered by tests, should not have bug, and is fully documented.

Documented you said? Right, it is documented with Gherkin files, but no one outside the development team can see them!

Here comes the magic of a tool like **pickles** that is able to extract gherkin files (language agnostic) and produce something visible by everyone.

# Play with pickles

Download [pickles](http://www.picklesdoc.com/) in command line, and try to generate a website containing project documentation.
